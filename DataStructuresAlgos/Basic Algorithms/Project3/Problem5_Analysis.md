# Problem 5 Efficiency Analysis

Word tries have time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of characters in the word and space complexity of O(m) where m is the number of characters in all of the words in the trie combined.  In order to find the suffixes of a given prefix we use a recursive solution.  This will have time and space complexity of O(n) where n is the number of characters in all of the suffixes.  We needed to use a recursive approach given that we did not know how many suffixes there were or how many characters in each.  We use this data structure as it allows us to store many words without having to redundantly store the same characters every time a words have the same prefix.
