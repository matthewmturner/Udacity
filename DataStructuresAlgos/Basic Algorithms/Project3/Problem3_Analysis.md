# Problem 3 Efficiency Analysis

In order to solve this problem I knew that I would need to sort the values in the list so that I could take the largest values and put them in the beginning of the created lists which would ensure I arrived at the largest output.  I implemented Quicksort for this as it's expected time complexity is O(n log(n)). After doing this I then need to iterate over half the list twice (half because I will take every other digit).  These operations will sum to have complexity of O(n) complexity.  This leaves me with complexity of O(2n log(n)) but this simplifies to O(n log(n))
