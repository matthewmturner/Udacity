# Problem 4 Efficiency Analysis

With conditional logic this problem was easy to solve in linear time O(n) and space complexity.  Given that we know that there are only 3 possible values in the input list it is easy to add each of those values to separate lists and then concatenate the lists which is done in constant time of O(1).  By doing this we only need to traverse the list once to group the numbers and then perform two appends.
